### Installation Steps:
1. Click "Download for Windows" (64-bit recommended)
2. Save the installer
3. Run the installer
4. **Important settings during install:**
   - Default editor: VS Code (or your choice)
   - Adjusting PATH: **"Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"** ‚úÖ
   - Line ending conversions: **"Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style"** ‚úÖ
   - Terminal emulator: **"Use Windows' default console window"** ‚úÖ

5. Click "Install"
6. Wait for completion

```powershell
git --version
```

You should see something like: `git version 2.xx.x.windows.x`

## Step 2: Upload to GitHub (2 minutes)

After Git is installed, open a **NEW** terminal in your project folder and run:

### Option A: Use the Upload Script (Easiest)
```powershell
cd "e:\Ghra sethu"
.\upload_to_github.bat
```

This will automatically:
1. Initialize Git
2. Add all files
3. Create commit
4. Add remote repository
5. Push to GitHub

### Option B: Manual Commands
```powershell
cd "e:\Ghra sethu"

git init

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Gharsethu full-stack home management app

- Flutter frontend with 6 feature modules
- Node.js backend API  
- Firebase integration
- Complete authentication flow
- Family management system
- All features integrated with Firestore
- Beautiful Material Design 3 UI
- Production-ready architecture"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin https://github.com/legend12309/home-management-app.git

git push -u origin main
```

**Important:** When prompted for credentials:
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

---

## Step 3: Create Personal Access Token

If you haven't created one yet:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Gharsethu Upload"
4. Select scopes:
   - ‚úÖ `repo` (all checkboxes under it)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when Git prompts

---

## Step 4: Verify Upload

After successful upload:

1. Visit: https://github.com/legend12309/home-management-app
2. Check that all files are there
3. Your code is now live!

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "e:\Ghra sethu"

# Check Git version (after install)
git --version

# Initialize Git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your message"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/legend12309/home-management-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Git not found" after installing
- Close and reopen your terminal
- Restart your computer if needed
- Check Git was added to PATH during install

### "Authentication failed"
- Use Personal Access Token, not password
- Token needs `repo` scope

### "Repository already exists"
Run this first:
```powershell
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```
Then push again

### "Permission denied"
- Verify you have access to the repository
- Check you're using the correct username
